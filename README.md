## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tyler. I'm a Software Engineer working in the trading industry who loves exploring new tech.

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, GPU programming, and game development.
    ðŸŒ± I love physics, math, biology, and AI. Pretty much all things science.
    ðŸ›  I primarily use C# and SQL for work, but I know many languages leading with Rust, C++, and Python.
    ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to collaborate on improving C# tooling for Neovim.
    âš¡ Fun facts: My first programming was hacking videogames, starting with Mario Kart Wii.
